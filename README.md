# Virtual Threads

Virtual Threads is a lightweight Java library for managing virtual threads, introduced in Java 19 as a preview feature that provides a high-level abstraction for concurrent programming. 

With the release of JDK 21 LTS on 19th Sept 2023, Virtual Threads will be production ready.

This repository contains the Virtual Threads library along with usage examples and documentation.

## Introduction
Virtual Threads offer a new way of handling concurrency in Java by providing a more scalable and efficient alternative to traditional threads and executors. They are designed to be lightweight and flexible, making them well-suited for a wide range of concurrent programming tasks.

This repository serves as a demo project for the Virtual Threads library, offering usage examples.

## Getting Started
To get started with Virtual Threads, you'll need:

Java 19 or later installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
The Virtual Threads library simplifies concurrent programming by providing an intuitive API for managing virtual threads. Whether you're working on a small-scale project or a large-scale application, Virtual Threads can help you achieve better concurrency control and resource utilization.

This project showcases examples to help you understand how to leverage Virtual Threads to improve your application performance. You can find these examples in the Service directory.

Both the examples (demo methods) in this project can be used to compare Traditional Threads with Virtual Threads.

We can run 1 demo at a time from the main class.

Feel free to explore these examples to gain a better understanding of how Virtual Threads can be applied in different scenarios.

For usage guidelines and API documentation, please check out the official Java Documentation.
